JAM CIRCLE-CRUZ
Jam Connect's greatest feature, jam circle, powered by D3's tree layout, is about the idea of starting with one instrument or sound, letting other users add their sound to yours, and watching it develop into many forms. Anyone can create a jam circle, but only people that were invited can see and add to the jam circle. You can add a layer of sound to the newest clip, or to clips that have already been added to. This way, the jam circle holds many different audio stacks.After a few uploads, the jam circle becomes an amazing development which started from a simple, easy rhythm/sound. Don't forget, If you like how a musician sounds You can also contact other users by click on their name.
