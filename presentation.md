SEARCH-CRUZ
Searching, in Jam Connect, is real easy. All you have to do is enter a zipcode, a mile radius, and hit search. You can also choose one specific instrument and genre, but if you leave both blank, you will get all kinds of search results.

JAM CIRCLE-CRUZ
Jam Connect's sweetest feature is Jam Circle.
Jam Circle is music collaboration, but it's online.
Anyone can create one, but only creators and those invited have access.
When creating, title required, description optional.
After some user uploads, you'll see how the audio stacks up.
This is powered by D3's tree layout.
You can either play, download, or add to any sound clip already up.
It's awesome hearing how the audio comes together, piece by piece, beginning to end.
Don't forget, if you like how a musician sounds, you can contact them, by simply clicking, on their name.
And now, a small demo.
